												<h3 >About the Project</h3>
												<p>
													In Uganda, 80% of the population depends on contaminated water sources resulting to waterborne diseases yet proven point-of-use (PoU) water purification technologies exist. Boiling drinking water alone upsurges the carbon footprint and is energy-wise expensive for a population that is even food insecure. Backyard gardening as a practice to boost household food security has failed to catch-up partly due to lack of proper crop knowledge, irrigation techniques and water despite the household wastewater generated. Our objective is to create an inclusive water-food nexus that focuses on increasing household access to clean drinking water, 
													advance household knowledge and water reuse to boost food security. 
												</p>

												The specific objectives focus on:
												<ul>
													<li>Developing a mobile-phone driven technology to create a data driven distribution chain for existing proven PoU water technologies and advance an automated household crop irrigation program for backyard gardening</li>
													<li>building capacity and disseminating scientific crop production and appropriate PoU knowledge and technologies at household level. </li>
												</ul>

												The project immediately targets 200 households and 50 small urban gardens from Kasubi parish, Kampala city for pilot and proof-of-concept. We shall install 200 PoU water technologies of the solarsack and train households in proper crop irrigation and backyard gardening for optimum food production.

									The mWaF project targets the 19.8 million mobile-phone users in Uganda, of which 6 million are smartphone users and 46% (9.1 million people) are internet users8.  Most of these are situated in urban areas; with a population of about 7.4 million people; grappling with poor sanitation, hygiene, access to clean drinking water, waterborne diseases and food insecurity. The situation is worse in slum settlements which are usually pigeonholed by poverty and inadequate access to water and thus are susceptible to sporadic outbreaks of waterborne diseases and hunger. In Kampala alone, 53.6% of the 1.5 million urban population live under slum settings9. A slum is a densely populated urban informal settlement with inhabitants living in shoddy housing and low standards.

							<p>To achieve specific objective (ii), the project initially targets 200 households and 50 small urban gardens from Kasubi parish, one of the informal settlements of Kampala city for pilot to obtain proof-of-concept. Kasubi parish harbours about 384,386 people translating to about 11,372 people/km2 across its 9 zones, wrestling with safe water challenges and with existing pockets of backyard gardens9. The households will be sub-divided into 50 groups of upto 4 members from individual households, with each group having at least one backyard garden for training and demonstration purposes to the group. Throughout the pilot, the project shall assess the household vulnerability index to waterborne infections by rapid testing of individual household water quality using the V-2000 Multi-analyte photometer, after which they will be trained in using the m-App, m-Web and USSD platforms.</p>
							<br>
							<p>With <a href="https://solarsack.com/">Solar Sack</a> as the first PoU distributor on our platform, we shall conduct free trainings and install 200 PoU water technologies of the solarsack. This initiative is meant to introduce and build user confidence towards the
								adoption of PoU technologies. To supplement on the inbuilt crop and irrigation programs and training based in our mobile-phone platforms, we shall build capacity of household groups as well as two 3rd year Bsc. Agricultural Engineering students in urban farming by training them in proper wastewater reuse using biosand filters for efficient backyard crop irrigation systems and optimum food production. Sara et al. 2008, reinforces the potential of domestic greywater as an alternative irrigation source10 for food production and thus the project seeks to exploit this research aspect as well during pilot. Throughout and after pilot of the project, we shall evaluate progress based on the number of households reached, those trained in using PoU-technologies and backyard irrigation, improved water quality at household level and reduced household exposure to waterborne diseases, increased crop yields, and registered users (subscribers) on our fully functional mobile-phone platforms ready for commercialization and scale up.

							<h3>Why the project?</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="row fnt">
							<p>The mWaF-project bridges the digital divide in e-commerce by providing a fundamental solution to sustainable household water quality, water reuse, backyard irrigation and food production. Similarly, studies indicate that PoU technologies such as solar disinfection, chlorination, ceramic and biosand filters etc; are effective in improving household water quality and reducing diarrheal cases by upto 30 – 40%6.</p>
							<p>Therefore, increasing household access to PoU technologies and backyard crop irrigation could complement national efforts to: </p>

							<ol style="list-style: lower-roman;">
								<li> increase access to safe water (SDG 6) from 65 to 79% and 77% to 100% in rural and urban areas respectively (NDP II)7</li>
								<li>reduce the environmental carbon footprint due to boiling water (SDG 13)</li>
								<li>increase household savings since PoU’s like the solarsack cost as low as $2 per unit with a performance efficiency of 4 liters of clean water in 4 hours and reuse time of 500 cycles or a total of 2,000 liters (https://solarsack.com/)</li>
								<li>reduce under-5 child mortality rate, boost gains in health and well-being (SDG 3)</li>
								<li> increase water for crop production (NDP II) and boost household food security and zero hunger (SDG 2)</li>
								<li> Job creation and growth of the ICT sector through online trade and mobile finance (NDP II).</li>
