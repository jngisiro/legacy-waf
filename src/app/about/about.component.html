        <b>Project Title:</b> Application of Mobile-Phone Technology to Advance
        Access to Sustainable PointOf-Use Water Purification Technologies for
        Household Drinking Water & Wastewater Reuse for Backyard Food Production
        (mWaF).
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to clean and safe drinking water and nutritious food are key to
        uplifting public health, food security and sustainable development of
        the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Water borne diseases are reported to account for 4.1% of all global
        disease related deaths. In Uganda, Diarrhea alone is responsible for 22%
        of mortality of children under the age of five (5). Currently, water is
        predominantly boiled before drinking using biomass energy sources with
        wood being the commonest. This does not only cause upsurges in the
        carbon footprint through deforestation, but it is also expensive
        in-terms of energy costs for a population that is uncertain of attaining
        a food meal a day. Proven point-of-use (PoU) water
        purification/treatment technologies do not require boiling of water and
        are effective in mitigating health risks resulting from drinking unsafe
        water. Several novel and cost-effective PoU water treatment/purification
        technologies that have been tested are currently available on the
        Ugandan market. However, their use, accessibility and adoptability have
        been low
      </p>

      <p>
        Backyard gardening is a recommended practice to boost household food and
        nutrition security. There are several urban gardening techniques
        currently available, although their dissemination has been slow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Solutions are therefore needed to increase safe water availability in
        homes and communities, and food production for the ever-increasing urban
        population. This project aims at creating more distribution channels for
        existing and low-cost PoU water treatment technologies and urban
        gardening knowledge and services
      </p>

      <p>
        Our objective is to create an inclusive water-food nexus that focuses on
        increasing household access to clean drinking water, and advance
        household gardening knowledge and water reuse to boost food security.
      </p>

      <p>The specific objectives include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Developing a mobile-phone driven technology to create data driven
          distribution chains for existing proven PoU drinking water
          technologies and urban gardening techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
          Building capacity and disseminating PoU drinking water technologies
          and urban gardening knowledge and skills.
        </li>
      </ol>
